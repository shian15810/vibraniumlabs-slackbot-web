# Take Home Exercise: Slack Bot ðŸ¤–

## Objective:

Develop an interactive dashboard and Slack bot that integrates with OpenAIâ€™s GPT API to provide intelligent, context-aware responses to user queries. The dashboard should offer insights into query trends, user engagement, and common topics, serving as a monitoring and analytics tool for interactions with the bot.

You are expected to spend up to 48 hours on the exercise, and you are *not* expected to complete all of the requirements below. Given the scope of features, you will need to prioritize, design, and develop key functionalities, making thoughtful trade-offs to deliver a well-structured, high-impact solution.

As an AI-first company, we encourage the use of tools like Cursor, ChatGPT, and other AI-assisted development resources to enhance efficiency and productivity.

## Requirements:

### **Backend:**

- **Slack Integration:**
    - Set up a bot that listens to messages in a Slack channel.
    - The bot should first attempt to answer questions based on past Slack threads before falling back to general knowledge from OpenAIâ€™s GPT model.
- **OpenAI API Integration:**
    - Process user queries and generate appropriate responses.
    - Support retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by leveraging relevant past conversations and tools like [pinecone.io](http://pinecone.io).
- **Uploaded Files as Context:**
    - Allow users to upload files that the model can reference when answering questions.
    - Extract text from uploaded documents (e.g., PDFs, CSVs, or text files) and include this information in query responses.
- **Data Logging & Storage:**
    - Store query data, responses, timestamps, and metadata to generate insights.
    - Store Slack messages for historical context and better query responses.

### **Frontend (Dashboard UI):**

- **React-Based Interface:**
    - Use React (TypeScript preferred) with Next.js, Vite, etc. for frontend development.
    - Build a responsive and interactive UI for monitoring query insights.
- **Metrics Dashboard:**
    
    Display key statistics on the queries made via the Slack bot, including:
    
    - **Hot Keywords:** Show the most frequently used keywords across all queries.
    - **Trend Over Time:** Chart how query volume and keyword popularity change over time.
    - **Top Users:** Rank users by the number of queries made.
    - **User Query Trends:** Show individual user engagement trends over time.
    - **Response Effectiveness:** Track how often the bot resolves queries without requiring human intervention.
- **Chat Interface:**
    - Enable users to interact with the bot directly via the dashboard.
    - Provide a chat history with timestamps, showing past queries and responses.
    - Allow users to input queries and get responses without using Slack.
- **File Upload & Context Usage:**
    - Implement a file upload feature to let users provide additional context for queries.
    - Display uploaded files and allow users to see how they influence responses.
- **Slack Message Summarization:**
    - Display summarized Slack conversations and extracted insights.
    - Provide a searchable history of Slack conversations relevant to specific keywords.

### **Nice-to-Haveâ€™s:**

- **Testing:**
    - Write unit and/or integration tests for both frontend and backend.
- **Deployment:**
    - Deploy frontend using Vercel and backend using Heroku/AWS/GCP.
- **Authentication:**
    - Implement basic authentication via Slack OAuth or simple login.
- **Additional Features:**
    - Itâ€™s really up to your imagination. Sky is the limit!

We are very excited to see what you can accomplish with this exercise. Most importantly, have fun with it!

ðŸ‘‰ When completed, please reach out to Charles ([charles@vibraniumlabs.ai](mailto:charles@vibraniumlabs.ai)), cc Jay ([jay@vibraniumlabs.ai](mailto:jay@vibraniumlabs.ai)) and Reese ([reese@t1.co](mailto:reese@t1.co)) and share the link to your repository for the exercise. Charles will then set up a 30 minute debrief/demo. Good luck!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
